                <p>As a driven first-year computer science major, I'm seeking a demanding web developer internship. I am qualified to contribute to creative web solutions since I have a solid background in programming languages, including C++, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am also familiar with web development frameworks like ReactJS and Bootstrap. My experience as a branding and marketing officer has sharpened my teamwork, critical thinking, and adaptation abilities, even though I'm new to the IT field. While always learning and developing my skill set professionally, I am excited to apply my technical ability and enthusiasm for web development to design user-friendly products that promote corporate success.</p>
